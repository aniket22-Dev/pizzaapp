During the early 1900\u2019s, Italian immigrants in the windy city were searching for something similar to the Neapolitan pizza that they knew and loved. Instead of imitating the notoriously thin pie, Ike Sewell had something else in mind. He created a pizza with a thick crust that had raised edges, similar to a pie, and ingredients in reverse, with slices of mozzarella lining the dough followed by meat, vegetables, and then topped with a can of crushed tomatoes. This original creation led Sewell to create the now famous chain restaurant, Pizzeria Uno.",price:"Rs.708",img:"https://cdnimg.webstaurantstore.com/uploads/buying_guide/2014/11/pizzatypes-deepdish.jpg",quantity:0},{id:3,name:" New York-Style Pizza",Description:"With its characteristic large, foldable slices and crispy outer crust, New York-style pizza is one of America\u2019s most famous regional pizza types.
